# VXLAN & Linux

This lab explores the implementation of VXLAN with Linux. At the top
of `./setup`, there is the possibility to choose one variant. Only
IPv6 is supported. OSPFv3 is used for the underlay network. It can
takes some time to converge when the lab starts.

## Multicast

This simply uses multicast to discover neighbors and send BUM
frames. Nothing fancy. Only works if the underlay network is able to
route multicast.

## Unicast and static flooding

All VTEP know their peers and will flood BUM frames to all peers using
static default entries in the FDB. A single broadcast packet is
therefore amplified by the number of VTEP in the network. This can be
quite huge.

## Unicast and static L2 entries

Same as the previous setup, but learning of L2 MAC are disabled in
favour of static entries. The amplification factor stays exactly the
same but the size of the FDB is constrained by the static MAC. Unknown
MAC will be flooded.

## Unicast and static ARP/ND entries

Same as the previous setup, but we remove the static default entries
in the FDB. BUM frames are not flooded anymore but they can't go
anywhere. Static ARP/ND entries are added on each VTEP to make them
reply to ARP/ND traffic. This makes classic L3 traffic work, restrict
the IP and the MAC that can be used.

This is something that would work if you know in advance all MAC/IP
you will use (or have a registry to update them). No amplification
factor. No way to increase the size of a table above some limit. No
multicast/broadcast.
