Various network related labs
============================

I use those labs to test various stuff. Most of them are tailored to
my need. The most recent ones are more likely to work than the older
ones.

They are expected to run without being root on top of an up-to-date
Debian sid. Some of them are using User-Mode-Linux, some other are
using KVM.
